# A Roadmap towards Machine Intelligence #

The computational community has preferred to focus, in the last decades, on solving relatively narrow empirical problems that are important for specific applications, but do not address the overarching goal of developing general-purpose intelligent machines.

In this article, we propose an alternative approach:

- We first define the general characteristics we think intelligent machines should possess.

- We present a concrete roadmap to develop them in realistic, small steps.

Development of these steps is incrementally structured in such a way that, jointly, they should lead us close to the ultimate goal of implementing a powerful AI. Achieving the long-term goal of building an intelligent machine equipped with the desired features at once seems too difficult, we need to define intermediate targets that can lead us in the right direction.

## Ability to communicate ##

Any practical realization of an intelligent machine will have to communicate.
