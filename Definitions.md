## Machine Learning ##

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

Machine learning algorithms are typically created using frameworks that accelerate solution development, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

The basic concept of machine learning in data science involves using statistical learning and optimization methods that let computers analyze datasets and identify patterns. Machine learning techniques leverage data mining to identify historic trends and inform future models.

The typical supervised machine learning algorithm consists of roughly three components:

1. A decision process: A recipe of calculations or other steps that takes in the data and "guesses" what kind of pattern your algorithm is looking to find.

2. An error function: A method of measuring how good the guess was by comparing it to known examples (when they are available). Did the decision process get it right? If not, how do you quantify "how bad" the miss was?

3. An updating or optimization process: A method in which the algorithm looks at the miss and then updates how the decision process comes to the final decision, so next time the miss won't be as great.

## Types of Machine Learning ##

#### Supervised learning #####

The dataset being used has been pre-labeled and classified by users to allow the algorithm to see how accurate its performance is.

#### Unsupervised learning ####

The raw dataset being used is unlabeled and an algorithm identifies patterns and relationships within the data without help from users.

#### Semi-supervised learning ####

The dataset contains structured and unstructured data, which guides the algorithm on its way to making independent conclusions. The combination of the two data types in one training dataset allows machine learning algorithms to learn to label unlabeled data.

#### Reinforcement learning ####

The dataset uses a “rewards/punishments” system, offering feedback to the algorithm to learn from its own experiences by trial and error.

## Commonly Used Machine Learning Algorithms ##

The purpose of machine learning is to use algorithms to analyze data. By leveraging machine learning, a developer can improve the efficiency of a task involving large quantities of data without the need for manual human input.

### Linear Regression ### 

Linear regression is an algorithm used to analyze the relationship between independent input variables and at least one target variable.

Machine learning models can be employed to analyze data in order to observe and map linear regressions. Independent variables and target variables can be input into a linear regression machine learning model, and the model will then map the coefficients of the best fit line to the data.

### Logistic Regression ### 

Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification problems. Instead of continuous output like in linear regression, a logistic model predicts the probability of a binary event occurring.

Machine learning algorithms can use logistic regression models to determine categorical outcomes. When given a dataset, the logistic regression model can check any weights and biases and then use the given dependent categorical target variables to understand how to correctly categorize that dataset.

### Neural Networks ### 

Neural networks are artificial intelligence algorithms that attempt to replicate the way the human brain processes information to understand and intelligently classify data. Data is "fed-forward" through layers that process and assign weights, before being sent to the next layer of nodes.

### Decision Trees ### 

Decision trees are data structures with nodes that are used to test against some input data. The input data is tested against the leaf nodes down the tree to attempt to produce the correct, desired output.

### Random Forest ###

Random forest models are capable of classifying data using a variety of decision tree models all at once.

These random forest models generate a number of decision trees as specified by the user, forming what is known as an ensemble. Each tree makes its own prediction based on some inut data, and the random forest machine learning algorithm then makes a prediction by combining the predictions of each decision tree in the ensemble.

## Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks ##

Machine learning, deep learning and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.

The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. "Deep" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn't necessarily require a labeled dataset. Deep learning can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or image) and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another.

You can think of deep learning as "scalable machine learning".

Classical, or "non-deep", machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.

Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network.

The "deep" in deep learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers - which would be inclusive of the input and output - can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network.

## Machine Learning (ML) vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI) ##

AI refers to any of the software and processes that are designed to mimic the way humans think and process information. It includes computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), robotics, autonomous vehicle operating systems and machine learning.

Machine learning specifically refers to teaching devices to learn information given to a dataset without manual human interference

## Why Is Machine Learning Important ##

-Scale of data: Companies are faced with massive volumes and varieties of data that need to be processed.

-Unexpected findings: The iterative nature of learning is unique and valuable because it occurs without human intervention - in other words, machine learning algorithms can uncover hidden insights without being specifically programmed to do so.
